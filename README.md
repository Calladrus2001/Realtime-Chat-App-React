# Realtime-Chat-App-React

### Installation guide
1. Clone this repo.
2. Create a new Supabase project and add `project url` and `anon key` to the `.env` file as mentioned.
3. To create the necessary tables other than `auth.users` (which is already created at the time of supabase init), run the following SQL query in the Supabase SQL Editor:
```
create table public.channels (
  id            bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  inserted_at   timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  slug          text not null,
  created_by    uuid references auth.users not null
);
comment on table public.channels is 'Topics and groups.';

create table public.messages (
  id            bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  inserted_at   timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  message       text not null,
  user_id       uuid references auth.users not null,
  channel_id    bigint references public.channels on delete cascade not null
);
comment on table public.messages is 'Individual messages sent by each user.';

create table public.participants (
  channel_id    bigint references public.channels on delete cascade not null,
  user_id       uuid references auth.users not null,
  primary key (channel_id, user_id)
);
comment on table public.participants is 'Participants in channels.';

create table public.contacts (
  id            bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  inserted_at   timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null,
  user_id       uuid references auth.users not null,
  contact_id    uuid,
  contact_email text not null,
  contact_name  text not null,
  constraint unique_contact unique (user_id, contact_email)
);
comment on table public.contacts is 'User contacts.';
comment on column public.contacts.contact_id is 'ID of the contact user if the user exists.';
```
4. In the project's root directory run `npm install`
5. To start the project run `npm run dev`

### Some Key Design decisions:
- `Contacts` table has an attribute `contact_id` which is the uuid of the user who is being added as a contact. Initially, it will be NULL since we cannot verify if user exists as we cannot access `auth.users` schema from client-SDK. However while fetching contacts for __channel creation__ we will only display those whose `contact_id` is not NULL. Whenever a new user is created, we update the contacts table to find users who have the former's info listed and update the `contact_id` from NULL to the actual value. This is not an IDEAL situation. The correct approach would be to verify the same server-side, but that is for future development. To handle the case where the contact already exists, we can update `contact_id` when that user logs in.
